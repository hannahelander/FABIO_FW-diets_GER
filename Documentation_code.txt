Code structure and documentation
 
This Project relate to the study:  (link will follow)

Units: Y: tons, E$Biomass: tons, E$Land_use: hectars, E$Blue_water: m3

Script names and functions:

0_load_original_data.R

- load FABIO-data: E, L, X and Y-matrices

1a_generate_index.R

- create an index df to access data in matrices

1b_prep_food_waste_data.R

- This script is used to construct the different tables of food waste data that feed in to both the 
generation of Y-vectors (for different scenarios) and the footprint calculations. It reads FWL data 
from files.


2_footprints.R

- This script calculates the footprints along the supply chains. It generates footprints and losses 
at each stage for vegetal- and animal products seperately. 

2b_quantities.R

-FWL was quantified along the supply chain in terms of mass. This serves to compare mass and footprints. 
In this script we also generated the Y-vector for eaten food for SQ, e.i. subtracting the FWL to identify 
what is eaten, and thus also calculate the current average diet. 

3a_generate_diet_DGE 

-This script create a Y-eaten matrix for DGE-recommendation by using percentage of product groups. It 
also generate a first version of the DGE nutrition circle, which is later scaled according to energy 
demand in excel. Based on this diet and nutrition table, the other diets are later generated in excel. 

3b_Diets_all.R

- Reads diets from excel. Generate Y-vectors for the different scenarios (diets and waste scenarios + 
min/max-levels of waste). 

4a_Product_characterization
- Part A: Calculate Biomass, Cropland and Water footprint associated with each food category.
- Part B: Quantify the amount of food waste of each food category that is associated with each diet.
- Part A & B together are used to create the input data to "5d_visualization_product_charact.R" Where Product
characteristics are ploted.
